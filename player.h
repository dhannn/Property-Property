    I've been reading about data structures 
    for a while now and just recently, I learned 
    how to implement a linked list.

    And so, naturally, I wanted to try it in this 
    project. Luckily, there is a part in my program
    where I need to refer to previous position 
    which is a perfect fit for a stack data structure
    (I think).

    I know a simple "currentPosition" variable, a simple
    "previousPosition" variable and a swapping function
    can do the job just as easily but where's the fun
    in that? ðŸ˜…
