/*
    NOTE: I was reading about linked list the other day and decided to try
    implementing it.

    I got so excited when I was successful so I decided to incorporate it
    in my MP.

    So I implemented a linked-list version of a stack especially since
    there are moments in the game where I have to compare the current
    position to the previous position.

    I know this is easily doable by making "previousPosition" and
    "currentPosition" variables but it isn't as fun and challenging ðŸ˜…

    (And by "not as challenging", I meant there wasn't enough segfaults
    to make my hair split ðŸ˜‚)
